                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Every year, TechMUN hosts a variety of committees focusing on international issues that encourage delegates to find solutions to the worldâ€™s prevailing problems. An essential part of being able to combat these problems is taking measures to support the organizations that actually put our plans into action. Every TechMUN, we choose a charity to fundraise for and donate to, and this year we are working with the Yemen Aid program of the Direct Relief Foundation.</p>
                <p style="padding-top: 20px">&emsp;&emsp;Recent warfare and disease outbreak in Yemen has led 75% of the population to require some form of humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The World Food Programme estimates that more than 20 million Yemenis are food insecure due to blockades at major ports that prevent aid from entering the country. Overall, less than 40% of hospitals in the country remain functional. As one of the frontrunning combatants providing aid to these victims, Direct Relief has shipped over 66 tons of medicines and medical supplies to Yemen over the past two years to local groups through Yemen Aid. Cholera Treatment Kits have also been sent to combat the cholera outbreak that infected over 1.1 million people. For more information on the charity, please visit <a href="https://www.directrelief.org/2019/01/yemen-delivering-health-in-a-conflict-zone/" target="_blank">https://www.directrelief.org/2019/01/yemen-delivering-health-in-a-conflict-zone/</a>. This year at TechMUN we are excited to announce our goal of raising $2,000 for the Direct Relief Foundation!</p>
